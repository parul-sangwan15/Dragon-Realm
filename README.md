# Dragon-Realm
The project involves scanning an image to spawn an object (something that has wings so most probably a dragon) and moving it around using a joystick. 
This project aims to provide users with an immersive and interactive experience with augmented reality. By spawning a dragon and moving it around using a joystick, we can create a fun and engaging experience showcasing AR technologyâ€™s potential. It's also an excellent way for me to learn about AR development and gain experience working with Unity and AR toolkits.
